** Instructions: **
* Create the def go_up(self): method
* Remember the y_vector deals with vertical movement. So check whether or not the snake is already moving up before changing its direction 
* Change the y_vector value to 10 after checking whether or not the snake is already moving up and set the x_vector to 0
* HINT: please check the example codes for the other go methods. Remember, the x vector refers to moving horizontally while the y_vector refers to moving vertically. Vectors can be negative   as well.

** Example ** 
def go_up(self):
    if self.y_vector > 0:
        return “Going Up”
    self.y_vector = 10
    self.x_vector = 0
