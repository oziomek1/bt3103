<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> </p><ul><li>Create the def go_up(self): method. </li><li>Remember the y_vector deals with vertical movement. So check whether or not the snake is already moving up before changing its direction. Have the code return &quot;Going Up&quot; if the snake is already going up</li><li>Change the y_vector value to 10 after checking whether or not the snake is already moving up and set the x_vector to 0</li><li>HINT: please check the example codes for the other go methods. Remember, the x vector refers to moving horizontally while the y_vector refers to moving vertically. Vectors can be negative as well. </li></ul>
