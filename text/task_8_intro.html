<p><strong>Game Class</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>We will be defining a <strong>boolean method</strong> called <em>check_eat</em> in this task. </li>
<li>Previously, we mentioned two important key points in Game class: <ul>
<li>Each Game class has a Snake object assigned to the attribute <em>snake</em></li>
<li><em>snake</em> has a list of Cells objects assigned to the attribute <em>cells</em> which can be accessed using self.snake.cells</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, we will be introducing an additional <em>Snack</em> attribute which is a Cell object but it represents a Snack in game.</li>
</ul>
