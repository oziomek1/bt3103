* Great job so far! Now to the fun part, creating the actual snake.

* There are many instance attributes for our snake class, but we will only focus on the important ones.

* We will start with the length and getLength method

class Snake():
    def __init__(self, ... length....):
        ...
        self.length = length
        ...
        ]
    def getLength(self):
        return self.length

The length attribute defines how long our snake will be when starting the game. Later, we will be modifying length to keep track of the score

The getLength method simply returns how long the snake is. We will use this to return the score when the game is over

Remember to call a method, you must first create an instance of the class (object) and call the method from that. Like so:

s = Snake(5)

s.getLength()

>> 5
