** Class Snake ** 
* Congrats on getting the length of the snake! Now, we can use getLength to calculate our score :)
* Let’s start to do more challenging tasks. We will now create the methods to control the snake. 
* Let’s go over some variables and  methods you should understand before we proceed

** How our snake is displayed on the screen ** 
Each individual bit of our snake is a Cell Object. These cell objects are stored in a list like so:
1. def __init__(self,...):
2.        ...
3.        self.cells = [
4.            Cell(cell_size=self.cell_size, x_position=x_position, y_position=y_position, color=self.color, display_window=self.display_window)
5.       for i in range(length) ]
* self.cells is a list creating instances of the class Cell. It will create as many cells as there are defined in length, hence the for loop. 

Def move defines how the snake moves along the screen. The method uses the cells list.
1. def move(self):
2.        x_position_new, y_position_new = self.calculate_new_cell_positions()
3. 
4.        self.cells.pop()
5.        self.cells.insert(0,
6.            Cell(cell_size=self.cell_size, x_position=x_position_new, y_position=y_position_new, color=self.color, display_window=self.display_window),
7.        )

* x_position_new, y_position_new = self.calculate_new_cell_positions() calls another method, which we won’t show because it is too complicated and unnecessary to know, to return new (x, y)    coordinates of the snake. 
* x_position_new, y_position_new = self.calculate_new_cell_positions() calls another method, which we won’t show because it is too complicated and unnecessary to know, to return new (x, y)    coordinates of the snake. 
* In coding terms: self.cells.pop() and self.cells.insert() moves the last element to the front of the cells list. 

**Methods**
* x_vector and y_vector refer to what the vertical and horizontal speed of the snake are.
* Remember, vectors can be negative. Negative x and y vectors refer moving left and down respectively 

The snake can move in four directions. In this exercise, we will give you three directions and you will be responsible for coding the last one. 

def go_left(self):
    if self.x_vector > 0:
        return
    self.x_vector = -10
    self.y_vector = 0

def go_right(self):
    if self.x_vector < 0:
        return
    self.x_vector = 10
    self.y_vector = 0

def go_down(self):
    if self.y_vector < 0:
        return
    self.y_vector = 10
    self.x_vector = 0

* These methods change the speed of the snake. The method calculate_new_cell_positions() briefly mentioned earlier will then use these new values to calculate the new position of the snake    after it turns. 
* The if statements check whether or not the snake is currently moving in the direction the user tries to move it. So for example, a snake cannot go left if it is already moving left. 
* So for go_left(), if x_vector is negative, or is moving left, then the code won’t run the rest of the method, since the snake is already moving left. Otherwise, it will change the           x_vector to a negative value (-10) and keep the y_vector to zero. 
* There can only be one nonzero value for the x and y vectors. Otherwise, the snake will move diagonally across the screen.
* These methods change the vectors of the snake. The method calculate_new_cell_positions() briefly mentioned earlier will then use these new vector values to calculate the new position of     the snake after it turns.
