** Class Square ** 
Let's start by creating the Square Class, the basis of everything in the Snake game. 
* As the name implies, the Square class will create squares on the display. 
* This square class will be the blueprint to the snacks, the snake itself, and the boundaries we draw on the screen. Without this Square class, there is nothing on the screen. 
* The Square class is also parent class. Later, we'll go over how subsequent classes will inherit Square.

Basic skeleton of a class "Square":
1. class Square():
2.   def __init__(self, cell_size,x_position,y_position):
3.       self.cell_size = cell_size
4.       self.x_position = x_position
5.       self.y_position = y_position

Line by line breakdown: 
* In line 1, we use the keyword class to create a class 
* In line 2, def __init___ is our instance attributes, what types of attributes will each Square have? 
* We always start attributes with the keyword self, which refers to each specific instance of square. It helps keep track of all the attributes per each square instance. 
* Each square class has a particular size (cell_size) and a location on the display (x_position, y_position) 
* Lines 3 - 5 help define what each attribute should be
    self.cell_size refers to a particular instance of the square class. 
    So self.cell_size = cell_size means that for each instance of Square class, set cell size (self.cell_size) to whatever value is passed into the instance (cell_size). This is the same for both x_position and y_position
    For example, if I wanted to create a Square named s with a cell size of 15 and an x, y position of 0: 
    s = Square(15, 0, 0). This is known as instantiation. S is an object, or an instance of the class Square. 
    Values 15, 0, and 0 refers to the cell_size, x_position, and y_position respectively. And all those three values will be set to the attributes of object s (which is what self.cell_size, self.x_position, self.y_position is).
