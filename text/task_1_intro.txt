Let's start by creating the Square Class

As the name implies, the Square class will create squares on the display. This square class will be the blueprint to the snacks, the snake itself, and the boundaries we draw 
the screen. Without this Square class, there is nothing on the screen. The Square class is also a parent class. Later, we'll go over how subsequent classes will inherit Square.

Basic skeleton of a class "Square":

class Square():
    def __init__(self, cell_size,x_position,y_position):
        self.cell_size = cell_size
        self.x_position = x_position
        self.y_position = y_position
