<p><strong>Class Game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will be defining a method called <em>check_collide</em> which checks if the snake in the game had collided with the boundaries of the game or with a part of itself. </li>
<li>Before we proceed there are several parts we would like you to understand.<ul>
<li>Game class has a Snake object that is being stored as an attribute called <em>snake</em>. </li>
<li>Each Snake is being made up of cells objects and being stored as a list of cells. This list can be accessed by calling self.snake.cells  </li>
<li><em>Enumerate</em>() which takes in a list object and loops through it.</li>
<li><em>return</em> statement ends the execution of the function call and &quot;returns&quot; the result, i.e. the value of the expression following the return keyword. If the return statement is without an expression, the special value None is returned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
