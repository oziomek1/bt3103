Class Cell
Now, we will create a Cell Class
* As mentioned previously, the Cell class is the child of the Square class. The cell Class inherits its properties from the Square class
* Because of this relationship, the Cell class is also responsible for displaying the snacks, the snake, and the boundaries on the screen. 
* However, this Cell class can do more than the Square class. It’s also used to add length to the snake and to respawn new snacks after old ones are eaten. 
* In the game we are creating, we will be interacting more with Cell objects than Square objects. 

Basic skeleton of a cell class:
1. class Cell(Square):
2.    def __init__(
3.        self,
4.        cell_size=20,
5.        color=(255, 255, 255),  #RGB value for the color white
6.        x_position=None,
7.        y_position=None,
8.        display_window=None):
9. 
10.        self.cell_size = cell_size
11.        self.x_position = x_position
12.        self.y_position = y_position
13.        self.color = color
14.        self.display_window = display_window
15. 
16.    def draw(self):
17.        pg.draw.rect(
18.            self.display_window,
19.            self.color,
20.            pg.Rect(self.x_position, self.y_position, self.cell_size, self.cell_size

Line by line breakdown: 
* In line 1, class Cell(Square) means that class Cell inherited properties and methods from class Square
* In lines 3-7, we can see those inherited instance attributes from class Square in class Cell. The only difference is that we are now defining what the default cell size, color, and x/       y_position should be for all instances of class Cell. We can always change these values later when we create instances of the class Cell. 
* Line 8 is a new instance attribute specific to the class Cell. display_window refers to the width and height of the game display. We won’t go how that works specifically, as it’s not that 
* Lines 16-20 define a new method for class Cell, def draw(self). Essentially when the code calls the draw method from the Cell class, it will draw a cell. The dimensions and size used are    defined in lines 3-7.
